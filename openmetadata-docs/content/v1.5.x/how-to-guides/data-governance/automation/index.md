# How to Set Up Automations in OpenMetadata

In OpenMetadata, automations allow you to schedule and automate various tasks such as data profiling, metadata ingestion, or data quality tests. Automating these tasks helps streamline operations and ensures that your data is continually refreshed and up-to-date. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up automations in OpenMetadata.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you are logged into your OpenMetadata account.
- Alternatively, if you're exploring OpenMetadata, you can log in using the OpenMetadata Sandbox.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Automations

### Step 1: Access the Automations Section
In the OpenMetadata UI, navigate to **Govern>Automations**.  
This will take you to the Automations page where you can view and manage your existing automations.

### Step 3: Fill in Automation Details
In the pop-up window, provide the necessary information to set up the automation:
- **Automation Name**: Give a meaningful name to the automation for easy identification.
- **Description**: Add a brief description explaining what this automation will do (e.g., "Daily metadata ingestion for database XYZ").
- **Logic/Conditions**: Define any conditions or specific criteria needed for this automation to work (e.g., specific tables or columns to be included).  
  Ensure that the logic is set up as per your specific requirements to make the automation useful for your workflows.

### Step 4: Configure Automation Interval
Once you've filled in the required details, click **Next**.  
On the next page, youâ€™ll be prompted to select the interval for the automation. This defines how frequently the automation should run (e.g., daily, weekly, or custom intervals).  
Review your settings and click **Automate** once you are satisfied with the configuration.
